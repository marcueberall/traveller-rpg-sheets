# traveller-rpg-sheets
Custom pdf sheets for the Traveller RPG by Mongoose Publishing. I designed the sheets under the fair use policy (https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/pages/traveller-licensing).

# update
2024-12-22: Complete re-design of the character sheet. It now features a better readability by using lines below each field. Also the extended characteristics found in the Traveller Companion is a layer now, that can be turned off. Thanks to those reddit users who gave their feedback.

# todo
I am currently working on the robot, npc and vehicle sheet.
