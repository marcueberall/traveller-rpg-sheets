# traveller-rpg-sheets
Custom pdf sheets for the Traveller RPG by Mongoose Publishing. I designed the sheets under the fair use policy (https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/pages/traveller-licensing).

# update
### 2025-01-03
Added an autocalc field for unskilled tests. The value is calculated as -3 + value of "Jack of All Trades". Also the "Other" fields of character characteristics and ship power got the fancy lines below their fields.

### 2024-12-23
Re-design of the ship sheets now finished, npc (single & multiple) and vehicle sheets added.

### 2024-12-22
Complete re-design of the character sheet. It now features a better readability by using lines below each field. Also the extended characteristics found in the Traveller Companion is a layer now, that can be turned off. Thanks to those reddit users who gave their feedback.

I also removed the multiple files for fillable and printing use. There is now only a single file that can be used to print for manual, analog use.

A redesign of the ship sheet will follow tomorrow (hopefully). Until then, I decided to remove the old one from the repository to minimize confusion about different verions and designs.

# todo
I am currently working on the robot, npc and vehicle sheet.
